        description: Required. Returns history records after the specified `startHistoryId`. The supplied `startHistoryId` should be obtained from the `historyId` of a message, thread, or previous `list` response. History IDs increase chronologically but are not contiguous with random gaps in between valid IDs. Supplying an invalid or out of date `startHistoryId` typically returns an `HTTP 404` error code. A `historyId` is typically valid for at least a week, but in some rare circumstances may be valid for only a few hours. If you receive an `HTTP 404` error response, your application should perform a full sync. If you receive no `nextPageToken` in the response, there are no updates to retrieve and you can store the returned `historyId` for a future request.

      description: Adds a delegate with its verification status set directly to `accepted`, without sending any verification email. The delegate user must be a member of the same G Suite organization as the delegator user. Gmail imposes limitations on the number of delegates and delegators each user in a G Suite organization can have. These limits depend on your organization, but in general each user can have up to 25 delegates and up to 10 delegators. Note that a delegate user must be referred to by their primary email address, and not an email alias. Also note that when a new delegate is created, there may be up to a one minute delay before the new delegate is available for use. This method is only available to service account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.

      description: Creates a custom "from" send-as alias. If an SMTP MSA is specified, Gmail will attempt to connect to the SMTP service to validate the configuration before creating the alias. If ownership verification is required for the alias, a message will be sent to the email address and the resource's verification status will be set to `pending`; otherwise, the resource will be created with verification status set to `accepted`. If a signature is provided, Gmail will sanitize the HTML before saving it with the alias. This method is only available to service account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.
